King recalls that When, during the course of an interview for The New Yorker, I told the interviewer 
(Mark Singer) that I believed stories are found things, like fossils in the ground, he said that he didn't 
believe me. I replied that that was fine, as long as he believed that I believe it. And I do. Stories aren't 
souvenir tee-shirts or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer's 
job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. 
Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small, a seashell. Sometimes it's enormous, a Tyrannosaurus Rex with all 
those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the 
techniques of excavation remain basically the same.
When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple-there was nothing else I was 
made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't 
imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do. He is also often asked why he 
writes horror and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?" He says writers 
write about their obsessions: "Louis L'Amour, the Western writer, and I might both stand at the edge of a 
small pond in Colorado, and we both might have an idea at exactly the same time. We might both feel the urge 
to sit down and try to work it out in words. His story might be about water rights in a dry season, my story 
would more likely be about some dreadful, hulking thing rising out of the still waters to carry off sheep...
and horses...and finally people. Louis L'Amour's 'obsession' centers on the history of the American West; I 
tend more toward things that slither by starlight. He writes Westerns; I write fearsomes. We're both a little 
nuts.

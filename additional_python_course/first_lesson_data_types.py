print("Hello Wold")

# int - integer numbers 5,10,20
# float - floating point numbers 5.5, 10.02
# str - "helo" strings
# boolean - true/false

# Variable names

# 1. The variable name can only contain Latin letters, numbers and the underscore character;
# 2. The variable name must not contain spaces;
#3. The variable name should not start with a number;
#4. Case is important: var and Var are different variables.
# 5. Itâ€™s better not to call with a capital letter
# 6. When naming variables, remember that variable names should not coincide with keywords and
# names of built-in functions.
